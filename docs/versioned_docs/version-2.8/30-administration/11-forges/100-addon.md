# Addon forges

If the forge you're using does not comply with [Woodpecker's requirements](../../92-development/02-core-ideas.md#forges) or your setup is too specific to be added to Woodpecker's core, you can write your own forge using an addon forge.

:::warning
Addon forges are still experimental. Their implementation can change and break at any time.
:::

:::danger
You need to trust the author of the addon forge you use. It can access authentication codes and other possibly sensitive information.
:::

## Usage

To use an addon forge, download the correct addon version. Then, you can add the following to your configuration:

```ini
WOODPECKER_ADDON_FORGE=/path/to/your/addon/forge/file
```

In case you run Woodpecker as container, you probably want to mount the addon binary to `/opt/addons/`.

### Bug reports

If you experience bugs, please check which component has the issue. If it's the addon, **do not raise an issue in the main repository**, but rather use the separate addon repositories. To check which component is responsible for the bug, look at the logs. Logs from addons are marked with a special field `addon` containing their addon file name.

If you wrote or found an addon forge, please add it here so others can find it!

## Creating addon forges

Addons use RPC to communicate to the server and are implemented using the [`go-plugin` library](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin).

### Writing your code

This example will use the Go language.

Directly import Woodpecker's Go packages (`go.woodpecker-ci.org/woodpecker/woodpecker/v2`) and use the interfaces and types defined there.

In the `main` function, just call `"go.woodpecker-ci.org/woodpecker/v2/server/forge/addon".Serve` with a `"go.woodpecker-ci.org/woodpecker/v2/server/forge".Forge` as argument.
This will take care of connecting the addon forge to the server.

### Example structure

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "net/http"

  "go.woodpecker-ci.org/woodpecker/v2/server/forge/addon"
  forgeTypes "go.woodpecker-ci.org/woodpecker/v2/server/forge/types"
  "go.woodpecker-ci.org/woodpecker/v2/server/model"
)

func main() {
  addon.Serve(config{})
}

type config struct {
}

// `config` must implement `"go.woodpecker-ci.org/woodpecker/v2/server/forge".Forge`. You must directly use Woodpecker's packages - see imports above.
```
