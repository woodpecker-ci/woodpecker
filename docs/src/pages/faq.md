## What are the differences to Drone?

Apart from Woodpecker staying free and OpenSource forever, the growing community already introduced some nifty features like:
- [Multi pipelines](/docs/usage/multi-pipeline)
- [Conditional step execution on file changes](/docs/usage/pipeline-syntax#path)
- [More features are already in the pipeline :wink:](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pulls) ...

## Why is Woodpecker a fork of Drone version 0.8?

The Drone CI license was changed after the 0.8 release from Apache 2 to a proprietary license. Woodpecker is based on this latest freely available version.
