Welcome to this blog. This is our first post on this blog ...

<!--truncate-->

In the future we will post about our releases and other things like tutorials.

We are currently working on the `1.0.0` release of Woodpecker. This release will include a lot of new features and improvements which most of you probably already tested using the `next` tag.

If you have any suggestions or ideas for posts, feel free to open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker).
