We are proud to present you Woodpecker v1.0.0.
It took us quite some time, but now we are sure it's ready, and you should really have a look at it.

<!--truncate-->

We've refactored a lot of code, so contributing to the codebase should be much easier.
Furthermore, a ton of bugs where addressed and various enhancements introduced, along with some highly anticipated features.
With Woodpecker v1.0.0, you can now substantially improve and streamline your code pipelines,
empowering you to automate and optimize workflows like never before.
