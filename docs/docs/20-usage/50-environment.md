# Environment variables

Woodpecker provides the ability to pass environment variables to individual pipeline steps. Note that these can't overwrite any existing, built-in variables. Example pipeline step with custom environment variables:

```diff
steps:
  build:
    image: golang
+   environment:
+     - CGO=0
+     - GOOS=linux
+     - GOARCH=amd64
    commands:
      - go build
      - go test
```

Please note that the environment section is not able to expand environment variables. If you need to expand variables they should be exported in the commands section.

```diff
steps:
  build:
    image: golang
-   environment:
-     - PATH=$PATH:/go
    commands:
+     - export PATH=$PATH:/go
      - go build
      - go test
```

> Please be warned that `${variable}` expressions are subject to pre-processing. If you do not want the pre-processor to evaluate your expression it must be escaped:

```diff
steps:
  build:
    image: golang
    commands:
-     - export PATH=${PATH}:/go
+     - export PATH=$${PATH}:/go
      - go build
      - go test
```

## Built-in environment variables

This is the reference list of all environment variables available to your pipeline containers. These are injected into your pipeline step and plugins containers, at runtime.

## Global environment variables

If you want specific environment variables to be available in all of your pipelines use the `WOODPECKER_ENVIRONMENT` setting on the Woodpecker server. Note that these can't overwrite any existing, built-in variables.

    [...]
    environment:
      - [...]
+     - WOODPECKER_ENVIRONMENT=first_var:value1,second_var:value2
```

These can be used, for example, to manage the image tag used by multiple projects.

```diff
steps:
  build:
-   image: golang:1.18
+   image: golang:${GOLANG_VERSION}
    commands:
      - [...]
    environment:
      - [...]
+     - WOODPECKER_ENVIRONMENT=GOLANG_VERSION:1.18
```

## String Substitution

Woodpecker provides the ability to substitute environment variables at runtime. This gives us the ability to use dynamic settings, commands and filters in our pipeline configuration.

Example commit substitution:

```diff
steps:
  docker:
    image: plugins/docker
    settings:
+     tags: ${CI_COMMIT_SHA}
```

Example tag substitution:

```diff
steps:
  docker:
    image: plugins/docker
    settings:
+     tags: ${CI_COMMIT_TAG}
```

## String Operations

Woodpecker also emulates bash string operations. This gives us the ability to manipulate the strings prior to substitution. Example use cases might include substring and stripping prefix or suffix values.

| OPERATION          | DESCRIPTION                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `${param}`         | parameter substitution                           |
| `${param,}`        | parameter substitution with lowercase first char |
| `${param,,}`       | parameter substitution with lowercase            |
| `${param^}`        | parameter substitution with uppercase first char |
| `${param^^}`       | parameter substitution with uppercase            |
| `${param:pos}`     | parameter substitution with substring            |
| `${param:pos:len}` | parameter substitution with substring and length |
| `${param=default}` | parameter substitution with default              |
| `${param##prefix}` | parameter substitution with prefix removal       |
| `${param%%suffix}` | parameter substitution with suffix removal       |
| `${param/old/new}` | parameter substitution with find and replace     |

Example variable substitution with substring:

```diff
steps:
  docker:
    image: plugins/docker
    settings:
+     tags: ${CI_COMMIT_SHA:0:8}
```

Example variable substitution strips `v` prefix from `v.1.0.0`:

```diff
steps:
  docker:
    image: plugins/docker
    settings:
+     tags: ${CI_COMMIT_TAG##v}
```
