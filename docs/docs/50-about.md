# About

Woodpecker is a community-driven open source CI/CD tool. It is lightweight, fast and simple to use. It can be used with many different Git providers and runners.

## History

Woodpecker was originally forked from Drone 0.8 by [@laszlocph](https://github.com/laszlocph) in 2019 after its license model was changed.

A few important time points:

- [`2fbaa56`](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/commit/2fbaa56eee0f4be7a3ca4be03dbd00c1bf5d1274) is the first commit of the fork, made on Apr 3, 2019.
- The first release [v0.8.91](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/releases/tag/v0.8.91) was published on Apr 6, 2019.
- On Aug 27, 2019, the project was renamed to "Woodpecker" ([`630c383`](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/commit/630c383181b10c4ec375e500c812c4b76b3c52b8)).
- The first release under the name "Woodpecker" was published on Sep 9, 2019 ([v0.8.104](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/releases/tag/v0.8.104)).

## Differences to Drone

Woodpecker is a community-driven open source software published under the Apache License 2.0 and will always remain so. Drone CI is managed by [Harness](https://harness.io/) and is available in two editions: [Open Source under Apache License 2.0 and Enterprise under Polyform Small Business license](https://docs.drone.io/enterprise/#is-drone-open-source).
In terms of Drone's feature set, Woodpecker is somewhere between [Drone Enterprise and OSS](https://docs.drone.io/enterprise/#what-is-the-difference-between-open-source-and-enterprise), but also has some unique features.
