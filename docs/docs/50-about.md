## History

Woodpecker was originally forked by [@laszlocph](https://github.com/laszlocph) in 2019 from Drone 0.8 after licensing model was changed.

A few important time points:

- [`2fbaa56`](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/commit/2fbaa56eee0f4be7a3ca4be03dbd00c1bf5d1274) is the first commit of the fork, made on Apr 3, 2019.

- On Aug 27, 2019, the project was renamed to "Woodpecker" ([`630c383`](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/commit/630c383181b10c4ec375e500c812c4b76b3c52b8)).
- The first release under the name "Woodpecker" was published on Sep 9, 2019 ([v0.8.104](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/releases/tag/v0.8.104)).

## Differences to Drone

Woodpecker is a community-driven open source software published under Apache2 license that will always stay so. Drone CI is managed by [Harness](https://harness.io/) and available in two editions: [Open Source under Apache2 license and Enterprise under Polyform Small Business license](https://docs.drone.io/enterprise/#is-drone-open-source). In terms of functionality, Woodpecker is somewhere in between [Drone Enterprise and OSS](https://docs.drone.io/enterprise/#what-is-the-difference-between-open-source-and-enterprise).
