# Migrations

Some versions need some changes to the server configuration or the pipeline configuration files.

## 0.15.0

- Default value for custom pipeline path is now empty / un-set which results in following resolution:

  `.woodpecker/*.yml` -> `.woodpecker.yml` -> `.drone.yml`

  Only projects created after updating will have an empty value by default. Existing projects will stick to the current pipeline path which is `.drone.yml` in most cases.

  Read more about it at the [Project Settings](/docs/usage/project-settings#pipeline-path)
