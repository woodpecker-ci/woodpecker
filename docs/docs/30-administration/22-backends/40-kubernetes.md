# Kubernetes backend

:::info
Not all pipeline features are fully supported yet for this backend.
Check [the Kubernetes overview issue](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/issues/1513) for a summary.
:::

The kubernetes backend executes steps inside standalone pods. A temporary PVC is created for the lifetime of the pipeline to transfer files between steps.

## General Configuration

These env vars can be set in the `env:` sections of both `server` and `agent`.
They do not need to be set for both but only for the part to which it is relevant to.

```yml
server:
  env:
    WOODPECKER_SESSION_EXPIRES: "300h"
    [...]

agent:
  env:
    [...]
```

- `WOODPECKER_BACKEND_K8S_NAMESPACE` (default: `woodpecker`)

  The namespace to create worker pods in.

- `WOODPECKER_BACKEND_K8S_VOLUME_SIZE` (default: `10G`)

  The volume size of the pipeline volume.

- `WOODPECKER_BACKEND_K8S_STORAGE_CLASS` (default: empty)

  The storage class to use for the pipeline volume.

- `WOODPECKER_BACKEND_K8S_STORAGE_RWX` (default: `true`)

  Determines if `RWX` should be used for the pipeline volume's [access mode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes). If false, `RWO` is used instead.

- `WOODPECKER_BACKEND_K8S_POD_LABELS` (default: empty)

  Additional labels to apply to worker pods. Must be a YAML object, e.g. `{"example.com/test-label":"test-value"}`.

- `WOODPECKER_BACKEND_K8S_POD_ANNOTATIONS` (default: empty)

  Additional annotations to apply to worker pods. Must be a YAML object, e.g. `{"example.com/test-annotation":"test-value"}`.

## Job specific configuration

### Resources

The kubernetes backend also allows for specifying requests and limits on a per-step basic, most commonly for CPU and memory.
We recommend to add a `resources` definition to all steps to ensure efficient scheduling.

Here is an example definition with an arbitrary `resources` definition below the `backend_options` section:

```yml
steps:
  'My kubernetes step':
    image: alpine
    commands:
      - echo "Hello world"
    backend_options:
      kubernetes:
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 200Mi
            cpu: 100m
          limits:
            memory: 400Mi
            cpu: 1000m
```

### serviceAccountName

Specify the name of the ServiceAccount which the build pod will mount. This serviceAccount must be created externally.
See the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/) for more information on using serviceAccounts.

### nodeSelector

Specify the label which is used to select the node where the job should be executed. Labels defined here will be appended to a list already containing "kubernetes.io/arch".
By default the pod will use "kubernetes.io/arch" inferred from top-level "platform" setting which is deducted from the agents' environment variable CI_SYSTEM_PLATFORM. To overwrite this, you need to specify this label in the nodeSelector section.
See the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) for more information on using nodeSelector.

Example pipeline configuration:

```yaml
steps:
  build:
    image: golang
    commands:
      - go get
      - go build
      - go test
    backend_options:
      kubernetes:
        serviceAccountName: 'my-service-account'
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 128Mi
            cpu: 1000m
          limits:
            memory: 256Mi
        nodeSelector:
          beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type: p3.8xlarge
```

### Volumes

To mount volumes a persistent volume (PV) and persistent volume claim (PVC) are needed on the cluster which can be referenced in steps via the `volume:` option.
Assuming a PVC named "woodpecker-cache" exists, it can be referenced as follows in a step:

```yaml
steps:
  "Restore Cache":
    image: meltwater/drone-cache
    volumes:
      - woodpecker-cache:/woodpecker/src/cache
    settings:
      mount:
        - "woodpecker-cache"
    [...]
```
