# GitHub

Woodpecker comes with built-in support for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise.
To use Woodpecker with GitHub the following environment variables should be set for the server component:

```sh
WOODPECKER_GITHUB=true
WOODPECKER_GITHUB_CLIENT=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
WOODPECKER_GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
```

You will get these values from GitHub when you register your application.
To do so, go to Settings -> Developer Settings -> GitHub Apps -> New GitHub App.
