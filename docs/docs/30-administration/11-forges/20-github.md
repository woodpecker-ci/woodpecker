# GitHub

Woodpecker comes with built-in support for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise.
To use Woodpecker with GitHub the following environment variables should be set for the server component:

```bash
WOODPECKER_GITHUB=true
WOODPECKER_GITHUB_CLIENT=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
WOODPECKER_GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
```

You will get these values from GitHub when you register your OAuth application.
To do so, go to Settings -> Developer Settings -> GitHub Apps -> New Oauth2 App.

:::warning
Do not use a "GitHub App" instead of an Oauth2 app as the former will not work correctly with Woodpecker right now (because user access tokens are not being refreshed automatically)
:::

## App Settings

- Name: An arbitrary name for your App
- Homepage URL: The URL of your Woodpecker instance
- Callback URL: `https://<your-woodpecker-instance>/authorize`
- (optional) Upload the Woodpecker Logo: <https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84780935?s=200&v=4>

## Client Secret Creation

After your App has been created, you can generate a client secret.
Use this one for the `WOODPECKER_GITHUB_SECRET` environment variable.
