# docker-compose

The below [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration can be used to start a Woodpecker server with a single agent.

It relies on a number of environment variables that you must set before running `docker-compose up`. The variables are described below.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'

services:
  woodpecker-server:
    image: woodpeckerci/woodpecker-server:latest
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    volumes:
      - woodpecker-server-data:/var/lib/woodpecker/
    environment:
      - WOODPECKER_OPEN=true
      - WOODPECKER_HOST=${WOODPECKER_HOST}
      - WOODPECKER_GITHUB=true
      - WOODPECKER_GITHUB_CLIENT=${WOODPECKER_GITHUB_CLIENT}
      - WOODPECKER_GITHUB_SECRET=${WOODPECKER_GITHUB_SECRET}
      - WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET=${WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET}

  woodpecker-agent:
    image: woodpeckerci/woodpecker-agent:latest
    command: agent
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - woodpecker-server
    volumes:
      - woodpecker-agent-config:/etc/woodpecker
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - WOODPECKER_SERVER=woodpecker-server:9000
      - WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET=${WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET}

volumes:
  woodpecker-server-data:
  woodpecker-agent-config:
```

Woodpecker needs to know its own address. You must therefore provide the public address of it in `<scheme>://<hostname>` format. Please omit trailing slashes:

```diff title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'

services:
  woodpecker-server:
    [...]
    environment:
      - [...]
+     - WOODPECKER_HOST=${WOODPECKER_HOST}
```

Woodpecker can also have its port's configured. It uses a separate port for gRPC and for HTTP. The agent performs gRPC calls and connects to the gRPC port.
They can be configured with ADDR variables:

```diff title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'
services:
  woodpecker-server:
    [...]
    environment:
      - [...]
+     - WOODPECKER_GRPC_ADDR=${WOODPECKER_GRPC_ADDR}
+     - WOODPECKER_SERVER_ADDR=${WOODPECKER_HTTP_ADDR}
```

Reverse proxying can also be [configured for gRPC](../proxy#caddy). If the agents are connecting over the internet, it should also be SSL encrypted. The agent then needs to be configured to be secure:

```diff title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'
services:
  woodpecker-server:
    [...]
    environment:
      - [...]
+     - WOODPECKER_GRPC_SECURE=true # defaults to false
+     - WOODPECKER_GRPC_VERIFY=true # default
```

As agents run pipeline steps as docker containers they require access to the host machine's Docker daemon:

```diff title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'

services:
  [...]
  woodpecker-agent:
    [...]
+   volumes:
+     - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Agents require the server address for agent-to-server communication. The agent connects to the server's gRPC port:

```diff title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'

services:
  woodpecker-agent:
    [...]
    environment:
+     - WOODPECKER_SERVER=woodpecker-server:9000
```

The server and agents use a shared secret to authenticate communication. This should be a random string of your choosing and should be kept private. You can generate such string with `openssl rand -hex 32`:

```diff title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'

services:
  woodpecker-server:
    [...]
    environment:
      - [...]
+     - WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET=${WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET}
  woodpecker-agent:
    [...]
    environment:
      - [...]
+     - WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET=${WOODPECKER_AGENT_SECRET}
```

## Docker images

Image variants:

- The `latest` image is the latest stable release
- The `vX.X.X` images are stable releases
- The `vX.X` images are based on the current release branch (e.g. `release/v1.0`) and can be used to get bugfixes asap
- The `next` images are based on the current `main` branch and should not be used for production environments

```bash
# server
docker pull woodpeckerci/woodpecker-server:latest
docker pull woodpeckerci/woodpecker-server:latest-alpine

# agent
docker pull woodpeckerci/woodpecker-agent:latest
docker pull woodpeckerci/woodpecker-agent:latest-alpine

# cli
docker pull woodpeckerci/woodpecker-cli:latest
docker pull woodpeckerci/woodpecker-cli:latest-alpine
```
