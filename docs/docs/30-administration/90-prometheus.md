# Prometheus

Woodpecker is compatible with Prometheus and exposes a `/metrics` endpoint. Please note that access to the metrics endpoint is restricted and requires an authorization token with administrative privileges.

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 60s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'woodpecker'
    bearer_token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

    static_configs:
       - targets: ['woodpecker.domain.com']
```

## Authorization

An administrator will need to generate a user API token and configure in the Prometheus configuration file as a bearer token. Please see the following example:

```diff
global:
  scrape_interval: 60s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'woodpecker'
+   bearer_token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

    static_configs:
       - targets: ['woodpecker.domain.com']
```

## Unauthenticated Access

Alternatively, the unprotected `/metrics` endpoint might be exposed on the internal port. (Port is configurable via the `WOODPECKER_METRICS_SERVER_ADDR` environment variable, e.g. `:9001`.)
