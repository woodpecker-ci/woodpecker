# UI Development

To develop the UI you need to install [Node.js and Yarn](/docs/development/getting-started#nodejs--yarn). In addition it is recommended to use VS-Code with the recommended plugin selection to get features like auto-formatting, linting and typechecking. The UI is written with [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) as Single-Page-Application accessing the Woodpecker REST api.

The UI code is placed in `web/`. Change to that folder in your terminal with `cd web/` and install all dependencies by running `yarn install`. Start the UI locally with [hot-reloading](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41429055/8461267) by running: `yarn start`. To access the UI you now have to start the Woodpecker server.
For this you have to add the line `WOODPECKER_DEV_WWW_PROXY=http://localhost:3000` to your `.env` config and start the server after that as explained in the [debugging](/docs/development/getting-started#debugging) section.

The UI will now be served under [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (don't access the UI from port 3000 as that only show the UI without access to the actual api).

## Tools and frameworks

The following list contains some tools and frameworks used by the Woodpecker UI. For some points we added some guidelines / hints to help you developing.

- [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
  - use `setup` and composition api
  - place (re-usable) components in `web/src/components/`
  - views should have a route in `web/src/router.ts` and are located in `web/src/views/`
- [Windicss](https://windicss.org/) (similar to Tailwind)
  - use Windicss classes where possible
  - if needed extend the Windicss config to use new classes
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (similar to Webpack)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - avoid using `any` and `unknown` (the linter will prevent you from doing so anyways :wink:)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Volar & vue-tsc](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/) for type-checking in .vue file
  - use the take-over mode of Volar as described by [this guide](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471)
