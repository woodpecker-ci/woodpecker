        We want to present the next version of our app on Twitter.
        Therefore we want to post a catching text, so users will know why they should
        update to the newest version. If there is no special feature included
        just summarize the changes in a few sentences. Use #WoodpeckerCI, #release and fitting
        hashtags and emojis to make the post more appealing.
