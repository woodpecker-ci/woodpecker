        We want to present the next version of our app on Mastodon.
        Therefore we want to post a catching text, so users will know why they should
        update to the newest version. Highlight the most special features. If there is no special feature
        included just summarize the changes in a few sentences. The whole text should not be longer than 240
        characters. Avoid naming contributors from. Use #WoodpeckerCI, #release and
        additional fitting hashtags and emojis to make the post more appealing

        The changelog entry: {{ changelog }}
