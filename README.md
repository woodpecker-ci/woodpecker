## Usage

### .woodpecker.yml

- Place your pipeline in a file named `.woodpecker.yml` in your repository
- Pipeline steps can be named as you like
- Run any command in the commands section

```yaml
# .woodpecker.yml
pipeline:
  build:
    image: debian
    commands:
      - echo "This is the build step"
  a-test-step:
    image: debian
    commands:
      - echo "Testing.."
```

### Build steps are containers

- Define any Docker image as context
- Install the needed tools in custom Docker images, use them as context

```diff
 pipeline:
   build:
-    image: debian
+    image: mycompany/image-with-awscli
     commands:
       - aws help
```

### File changes are incremental

- Woodpecker clones the source code in the beginning pipeline
- Changes to files are persisted through steps as the same volume is mounted to all steps

```yaml
# .woodpecker.yml
pipeline:
  build:
    image: debian
    commands:
      - touch myfile
  a-test-step:
    image: debian
    commands:
      - cat myfile
```

### Plugins are straightforward

- If you copy the same shell script from project to project
- Pack it into a plugin instead
- And make the yaml declarative
- Plugins are Docker images with your script as an entrypoint

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM laszlocloud/kubectl
COPY deploy /usr/local/deploy
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/deploy"]
```

```bash
# deploy
kubectl apply -f $PLUGIN_TEMPLATE
```

```yaml
# .woodpecker.yml
pipeline:
  deploy-to-k8s:
    image: laszlocloud/my-k8s-plugin
    template: config/k8s/service.yml
```
