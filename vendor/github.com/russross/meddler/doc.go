// Package Meddler is a small toolkit to take some of the tedium out of moving data
// back and forth between SQL queries and structs.
//
// It is not a complete ORM. It is intended to be lightweight way to add some
// of the convenience of an ORM while leaving more control in the hands of the
// programmer.
//
// Package docs are available at:
//
// 	http://godoc.org/github.com/russross/meddler
//
// The package is housed on GitHub, and the README there has more info:
