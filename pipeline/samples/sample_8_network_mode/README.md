Compile the yaml to the intermediate representation:

```
pipec compile
```

Execute the intermediate representation:

```
pipec exec
```

This example shows how to use the network_mode option to use the network defined

Before to start you need to create a container that connects to the VPN (using one of
the openvpn client images like https://github.com/ekristen/docker-openvpn-client).
